# Features

- TBD



# Development

This is based upon the [cliff](https://docs.openstack.org/cliff/latest/index.html) command line frameworkwhich provides a clean separation of Command classes from which we can create a hierarchy of commands ala git etc. so that we may provide a logical noun-verb syntax to our utilities.
